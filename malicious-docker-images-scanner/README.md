# 🛡️ Hybrid Framework for Detecting Vulnerable and Malicious Docker Images

## 🧐 Overview
Think of this tool as a **forensic scanner for Docker images**.

Most standard security tools (like Trivy) only look at the "packing list" (metadata) to identify old software versions. They do not actually open the "suitcase" to see what is inside.

**This project changes that.** It creates a hybrid scanning pipeline that:
1.  **Extracts** the file system from a Docker image.
2.  **Scans** for hidden malware, viruses, and secrets (Static Analysis).
3.  **Executes** the container in a sandbox to watch for suspicious behavior (Dynamic Analysis).
4.  **Aggregates** all findings into a single **Risk Score (0-100)**.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Multi-Scanner Integration:**
    * **Trivy:** Detects OS and package vulnerabilities (CVEs).
    * **YARA:** Scans files for custom malware patterns (e.g., specific strings).
    * **ClamAV:** Scans for known virus signatures.
    * **Falco:** Monitors runtime system calls (e.g., unexpected shell usage).
* **Smart Risk Scoring:**
    * Calculates a normalized score (0-100).
    * **Critical Risk (100):** If *any* malware signature is found.
    * **High/Medium Risk:** Based on the severity of CVEs and runtime alerts.
* **Web Dashboard:**
    * Simple UI to input `image_name:version_tag`.
    * Real-time scanning status.
    * "Pass/Block" decision based on the final score.

## ⚙️ System Architecture

The scanner operates in a 4-step hybrid pipeline.

## 💻 Installation & Setup
**Recommended Environment:**
Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 LTS (Virtual Machine or Native).\
Note: This project relies on Linux-specific tools (Falco, ClamAV) and is optimized for Linux environments.
### 1. System Prerequisites
Run the following commands in your Ubuntu terminal to install the necessary engines:
```bash
# Update repositories
sudo apt-get update

# Install ClamAV & YARA (Antivirus & Pattern Matching)
#libyara-dev' is required for the Python YARA library to work correctly
sudo apt-get install clamav clamav-daemon yara libyara-dev -y

# Install Trivy (Vulnerability Scanner)
#Trivy is not in default repos, so we install it manually:` 
sudo apt-get install wget apt-transport-https gnupg lsb-release -y
wget -qO - [https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy-repo/deb/public.key](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy-repo/deb/public.key) | sudo apt-key add -
echo deb [https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy-repo/deb](https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy-repo/deb) $(lsb_release -sc) main | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/trivy.list
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install trivy

# Ensure Docker is installed and running
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```
(Note: Falco must be installed separately following the official Falco docs).

### 2. Clone & Install Project
```bash
git clone [https://github.com/AmritaCSN/malicious-docker-images-scanner.git](https://github.com/AmritaCSN/malicious-docker-images-scanner.git)
cd malicious-docker-images-scanner
```
```bash
# Create and Activate Virtual Environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
### 3. Run the Scanner
```bash
python3 run.py
```
The application will start on http://localhost:5000.

## 🕵️ Usage Guide

### 1. Scanning Standard Images (Docker Hub)
The scanner can analyze **any** Docker image present on your system (pulled from Docker Hub or built locally).

**Example: Scanning the official Nginx image**
1.  Pull the image first:
    ```bash
    docker pull nginx:latest
    ```
2.  Go to the Web Dashboard (`http://localhost:5000`).
3.  Enter the image name:
    ```text
    nginx:latest
    ```
4.  Click **Initialize Scan**. The tool will extract the file system and run all checks (Trivy, YARA, ClamAV, Falco).

### 2. Scanning Custom/Local Images
You can also scan images you have built yourself. Just ensure the image exists in your local registry by running `docker images`.

## 🧪 How to Test (Proof of Concept)
To prove the efficacy of the scanner, we have created custom "Dangerous" images that mimic real-world threats.

1. Build the Malware Test Image (Signature-based) This image contains the EICAR test string, which triggers YARA/ClamAV.
```bash
# Run inside /malware_test folder
docker build -f Dockerfile.signature -t dangerous-test-image:latest .
```
2. Build the Behavior Test Image (Runtime-based) This image runs a script mimicking a crypto-miner, which triggers Falco.

```bash
# Run inside /malware_test folder
docker build -f Dockerfile.behavior -t dangerous-behavior:latest .
```
3. Scan them!
* Go to http://localhost:5000.
* Scan dangerous-test-image:latest $\rightarrow$ Result: CRITICAL (Score: 100).
* Scan dangerous-behavior:latest $\rightarrow$ Result: HIGH RISK.
* Scan other images as well by following the same steps such as by entering the image name and the respective tag version.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

* **Error: `docker: permission denied`**
    * **Fix:** Run `sudo usermod -aG docker $USER` and restart your VM (or log out/in).
* **Error: `Falco: kernel module not found`**
    * **Fix:** Ensure you are running on a Linux host/VM. Falco does not support standard Windows/WSL2 kernels natively without specific tuning.
* **Scanner hangs on "Pulling image..."**
    * **Fix:** Check your internet connection. Docker Hub requires a stable network to download new layers.
